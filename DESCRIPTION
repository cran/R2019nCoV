Description: Since December 2019, Wuhan City, Hubei Province has continued to carry out surveillance of influenza and related diseases, and found multiple cases of viral pneumonia, all of which were diagnosed with viral pneumonia / pulmonary infection. On January 12, 2020, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus causing the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as "2019 New Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)". The current epidemic situation is very serious, here we developed an R package for 2019-nCoV analysis(Real-time monitoring and Visualization) by querying real-time statistics of 2019-nCoV virus cases from <https://view.inews.qq.com/g2/getOnsInfo?name=disease_h5&callback=1580373566110> and performing follow-up analysis.
